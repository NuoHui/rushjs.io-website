Rush is actively developed by a team within MS Office.  Although Microsoft does not provide official support for Rush, there are various community options for help:

- [Frequently Asked Questions]({% link pages/help/faq.md %})

- **Found a bug?** You can [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/rushstack/issues)
  in the **rushstack** monorepo where Rush is developed

- **Zulip**: Chat with Rush developers in the Rush Stack [Zulip chat room](https://rushstack.zulipchat.com/)

- **If a PR needs attention,** try asking in the
  [#contributor-helpline](https://rushstack.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/279883-contributor-helpline)
  chat room.  We carefully review each submission before merging, which is time consuming work.  The maintainers
  are all people who manage large corporate monorepos with regular daily distractions, so PRs frequently
  get overlooked.  Your contributions are greatly appreciated -- we do want to get that PR reviewed!
